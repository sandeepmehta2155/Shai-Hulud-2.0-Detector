## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates.

**When reporting a bug, include:**

1. **Clear title** - Summarize the issue in one line
2. **Environment details** - Node.js version, OS, GitHub Actions runner
3. **Steps to reproduce** - Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Expected behavior** - What you expected to happen
5. **Actual behavior** - What actually happened
6. **Screenshots/logs** - If applicable

**Example bug report:**

```markdown
## Bug: Scanner fails on yarn.lock v2 format

### Environment
- Node.js: 20.10.0
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 (GitHub Actions)
- Action version: v1.0.0

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a project with Yarn Berry
2. Run the Shai-Hulud detector
3. Observe the error

### Expected Behavior
Scanner should parse yarn.lock and detect compromised packages

### Actual Behavior
Error: "Unable to parse yarn.lock file"

### Logs
```
Error: YAML parse error at line 15
```
```

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for new features! Please include:

1. **Use case** - Why is this needed?
2. **Proposed solution** - How should it work?
3. **Alternatives considered** - What other approaches were considered?
4. **Additional context** - Screenshots, mockups, etc.

### Updating Package Database

The package database (`compromised-packages.json`) is critical for detection accuracy.

#### Adding a New Compromised Package

1. **Gather evidence** of compromise:
   - Link to security advisory
   - npm audit report
   - Analysis from security researchers
   - Presence of known malicious files

2. **Create a pull request** with:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "@scope/package-name",
     "severity": "critical",
     "affectedVersions": ["*"]
   }
   ```

3. **Include in PR description:**
   - Evidence of compromise
   - Affected versions (if known)
   - Source of information

#### Reporting False Positives

If a package is incorrectly flagged:

1. Open an issue with title: `[False Positive] package-name`
2. Provide evidence the package is clean:
   - Official statement from maintainers
   - Code audit results
   - Version that was remediated

### Code Contributions

We accept code contributions for:

- Bug fixes
- New features
- Performance improvements
- Documentation updates
- Test coverage

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- npm 10.x or higher
- Git

### Setup Steps

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub

# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Shai-Hulud-2.0-Detector.git
cd Shai-Hulud-2.0-Detector

# 3. Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/gensecaihq/Shai-Hulud-2.0-Detector.git

# 4. Install dependencies
npm install

# 5. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Building

```bash
# Build the action
npm run build

# This compiles TypeScript and bundles everything into dist/
```

### Testing Locally

```bash
# Set environment variables to simulate inputs
export INPUT_FAIL_ON_CRITICAL=true
export INPUT_SCAN_LOCKFILES=true
export INPUT_OUTPUT_FORMAT=text
export INPUT_WORKING_DIRECTORY=/path/to/test/project

# Run the action
node dist/index.js
```

### Creating Test Cases

Create test projects in a `test-fixtures/` directory (not committed):

```bash
mkdir -p test-fixtures/clean-project
cd test-fixtures/clean-project
npm init -y
npm install express lodash
cd ../..

mkdir -p test-fixtures/affected-project
cd test-fixtures/affected-project
echo '{"dependencies":{"posthog-node":"^5.0.0"}}' > package.json
```

## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use strict mode
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions

```typescript
/**
 * Scans a package.json file for compromised dependencies
 * @param filePath - Absolute path to package.json
 * @param isDirect - Whether to mark results as direct dependencies
 * @returns Array of scan results for affected packages
 */
export function scanPackageJson(
  filePath: string,
  isDirect: boolean = true
): ScanResult[] {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Commit Messages
